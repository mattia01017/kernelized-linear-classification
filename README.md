## Project structure
- **src**: contains all the source code
- **experiments**: contains the results in JSON format of the experiments performed in src/analysis.ipynb
- **hyperparameters**: contains the resulting hyperparameters after grid searches performed in src/analysis.ipynb
- **predictor_dumps**: contains the attributes (weights, epochs, ...) of the best performing non-kernelized models generated during the experiments
- **tex**: contains the report, both the .tex source and .pdf
- **plots**: contains all the generated figures, included also in the report
